# Legacy Loader  
Legacy Loader is a Minecraft mod loader for 1.12.2 based on ForgeGradle toolchain.  
Big piece of the buildscript code was just copy-pasted from Forge, so big + to them!  

## Installation  
## Contributing  
After cloning the repository, there will be a total of 3 projects inside the `sources/` directory, 
clean, mcp and minecraft. If you ever want to edit the source code of minecraft, use the `minecraft` 
project, `clean` exists just for the purpose of references during patching. Happy coding!  
To execute the modified code, run `sources:minecraft:fg_runs/getIntellijRuns` and run the first task.
